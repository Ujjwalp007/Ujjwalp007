# 👨🏽‍💻 Ujjwal Patidar

Hi! I'm **Ujjwal** — a **Computer Science** senior at **Drexel University** who gets unreasonably excited about well-designed data systems. My work sits at the intersection of **data engineering**, **data science**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **applied AI**. I like building things that take messy, real-world data and turn it into something an engineer or analyst can actually trust.

When I'm not working, I'm probably running, reading something non-fiction, or listening to the Weeknd :)

## 💼 Where I've Built Things

### **Penn Mutual Life Insurance** (*Software Engineer, Financial Core Services*)
Scala + Spark pipelines powering actuarial reporting for 1M+ policies. AWS Step Functions, EMR Serverless, strict data quality — the kind of work where "close enough" doesn't fly.

### **Exelon Corporation** (*Data Scientist, Infrastructure & Safety Analytics*)
Built GasGPT, an LLM-powered system for instant gas-standard regulatory answers. Flask + LangChain + Azure, containerized and deployed through CI/CD. Also wrangled Azure Tables and CosmosDB for chat history at scale.

### **Drexel VIP Research** (*Undergraduate Researcher*)
Multi-drone target tracking with ROS 2 + TensorFlow. Dockerized ML pipelines. The kind of project where you learn that production and prototype are very different words.

## 🚀 Work I'm Proud Of

### 🏎️ **Formula 1 Performance Analytics Engine**
20+ years of F1 data, one lakehouse to rule them all. Architected on **Azure Databricks** with **PySpark** ingestion across **8+ raw sources**, curated **Delta Lake** models, and a full **bronze → silver → gold** ETL architecture — incremental loads, merge-based upserts, partitioned storage, time-travel. Powered interactive **Power BI** dashboards using **Spark SQL** window functions that reveal the performance trends you always suspected but couldn't prove.

### 🏠 **Indomitable Families — IFAM Mobile App** *(Hack4Impact)*
Cloud + data layer from scratch for a React Native app backed by Cornell Tech Incubator, serving families affected by incarceration. Python Lambda microservices, API Gateway, Aurora Postgres, real-time notifications, CI/CD pipelines. The kind of build where the infrastructure decisions you make today decide whether the platform can still stand a year from now.
